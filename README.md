APL\11
======

This APL\11 is based on the apl11 source archive found in the Waterloo
APL archive.  This version has various Windows console keyboard interfaces,
using fixed-width console fonts, the APL! transliteration scheme on UNIX,
and UTF-8 terminal input under macOS.

Slightly extended with spawn() and TCP/IP support.

How to use it:
  * install the Dyalog keyboard layout and the APL385 Unicode font
  * change your terminal to UTF-8 support
  * run the `apl' executable

**Note**: There are excellent APL implementations like [Dyalog APL](https://www.dyalog.com), [NARS2000](http://www.nars2000.org). Otherwise here is the code. Good luck!
